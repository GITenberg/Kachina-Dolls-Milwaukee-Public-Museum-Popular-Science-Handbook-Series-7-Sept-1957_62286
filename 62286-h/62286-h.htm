<p>On the sentinel-like mesas in the semi-desert land of northeastern Arizona
dwell some 3,500 of one of our most colorful Indian tribes of today,
the Hopi. Living in their traditional adobe, multi-storied &ldquo;apartment
houses,&rdquo; called &ldquo;Pueblos,&rdquo; they practice many of their old ways and customs,
and remain one of the tribes least affected by the white man. Agriculturalists
they were and agriculturalists they are, filling the fields at the base of the
mesas, raising corn, beans, and squash, but above all, corn. In this area where
land is good, but moisture is all-important, the Hopi have developed a religion
much concerned with prayers and ceremonies to bring rain and good
crops. During the Snake Dance, for example, snakes are held in the mouths
of the dancers and then released into the desert as messengers to the gods
to inform them that the Hopi need rain.</p>
<p>Less widely known to the world than the Snake Dance, but very important
to the Hopi as a spiritual means of petitioning for rain, good weather, bountiful
crops, and other blessings, is the Kachina cult. The Hopi believe that the
Kachinas are a band of supernatural beings who live in the nearby mountains
and pay visits to the villages at intervals during the first half of each year.
At these times the men don the masks and costumes representing particular
Kachinas, and perform dances and ceremonies in their honor. By wearing
these costumes the men not only physically impersonate the Kachinas, but
also assume their spirits. The dances and ceremonies take place both in the
underground chambers, called kivas, where only men are allowed, and out on
the village plazas where all may watch. During the latter, the dancers follow
the leader in single file to the plaza where they line up facing east. The leader,
at the center, begins the singing to the rhythm of his rattle; then the others
join in, and the dancing begins. For the next song the dancers face north,
then west, after which they distribute gifts, usually a bow and arrow for a
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
boy and a Kachina doll for a girl. They then retire to a secluded area to
unmask, relax, and prepare for the next set of songs and dances.</p>
<p>In some of the dances 30 or 40 men will be dressed alike; in others a variety
of Kachinas participate. Besides the serious dances there are humorous
ones put on by clowns, or &ldquo;mudheads&rdquo; as they are popularly called. The mudheads
are distinguished by their distinctive, mud-colored masks and provoke
much laughter with their impromptu pranks and burlesquing of both Indian
and white man, and even of the Kachina dances.</p>
<p>While the term &ldquo;Kachina&rdquo; refers to the mythological beings, and to the
masked dancers who impersonate them, it is also used to refer to the dolls,
which are miniature but accurate reproductions of them. Kachina dolls are
made by the men to be given to the girls during the Kachina ceremonies.
Children eagerly await the Giver Kachina, the counterpart of our Santa
Claus, who wears a blue mask and carries a bundle of gifts on his back. His
arrival is announced by a herald stationed on a roof top. He passes among
the crowd distributing gifts to the children, such as candy, bows and arrows,
and the especially desired Kachina dolls. Each girl receives at least one, and
some may receive as many as a half dozen. They are played with as dolls,
often being carried about in miniature cradles. They also, however, serve a
useful purpose in acquainting the Hopi children with the names, kinds, details
of costumes, and religious lore of the Kachinas. In a very real sense, then,
they are the educational toys of the Hopi. The dolls are never worshipped
and are not to be considered idols, but rather serve as constant reminders
of the Kachinas, especially during the summer and fall when the Kachinas
have returned to their mountain home. They are handled and carried about
the village by the girls, but for the most part they will be seen hanging from
the walls or rafters of the pueblo rooms.</p>
<p>The dolls described in this booklet are but a few of the many types. Not
even the Hopi can tell you how many different Kachinas there are, but their
number has been estimated at 250. Only about 200 are in current use, and
these change with the years as new ones are added, and others disappear
from usage.</p>

<p>Our Southwest is a veritable treasure chest of
interesting things made by clever Indian craftsmen.
Here and there, at Indian trading posts or Indian roadside
stands along the way, among the rugs, sashes, pottery,
and silver and turquoise jewelry, you will find
Kachina dolls. Not too many. Up until a few years ago
they were quite scarce in the trading posts, but could be
bought at the various Hopi pueblos, where the best ones
are made. While they were originally made for their
little girls, as stated in the preface, they produced even
more of them when it was discovered that tourists prized
them. And like everything else, someone saw a chance
to earn a dollar and started to manufacture them. Some
years ago the Japanese even went so far as to make them
of papier-mache. Many of them are machined and given a quick coat of paint.
But you can still buy good Kachina dolls both on the mesas and at trading
posts.</p>
<p>All in all the Hopi-made dolls are good, and usually when you find one a
bit worn, with a cord around its neck, you can figure that at one time it
adorned a pueblo wall. The Hopi Kachina makers take great pride in their
work. Their dolls are made out of cottonwood roots, which gives them that
sort of rough texture that is pleasing to the eye. Some of the very old dolls
have cloth and buckskin clothing to make them more realistic, but for the
most part they are made entirely of wood with the exception of feathers and
fluffs, as shown in the following pages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>As mentioned before, there are about 250 different Kachinas, but the Hopi
do not make that many different dolls. There are certain Kachinas that lend
themselves better to carved dolls, and it is with these that we will deal.</p>
<p>Years ago, when starting out boys and girls in whittling, I made it a practice
to give them Kachina dolls to whittle, for various reasons. It acquainted
them with the feel of wood and the meaning of grain. It taught them how to
sharpen a knife, and how to use it. And best of all, they whittled figures
without having to worry about human faces, which are the bugaboo of all
whittling novices, and a lot of others, too.</p>
<p>This booklet will mainly show how Kachina dolls are whittled and painted,
and to what use they can be put. This is not an ethnological thesis, but is
written for the craft-minded who like to whittle, and who like Kachina dolls.
I do not imagine that anyone will make all of the objects listed and described,
but there may be one or more of them that you will enjoy making.</p>
<p>The first thing you will need is a piece of wood. Since it would be rather
difficult to obtain cottonwood roots, our next best bet is a piece of straight-grained
soft wood. I have used sections of green, knot-free basswood, willow,
and poplar saplings or branches with good results. A piece of wood about
1&frac12; inches in diameter is of a proper size to start out with. The green wood
whittles easily and, due to the short lengths and deep cuts, it is not likely to
check. And of course it is already round.</p>
<p>Also, white pine, sugar pine, and basswood can usually be bought at a
lumber yard or millwork shop. It should be cut in rectangular sections and
then rounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Then, of course, you will need a knife that holds an edge. A good quality
of pocket knife is best, and all the whittling I have ever done has been with a
small blade, from 1&frac14; to 1&frac12; inches long. As the knife comes from the store
it is not sharp enough for whittling. So get a small abrasive stone, and a piece
of leather to strop it on, and sharpen it until you cannot see the edge; as
long as you can see a &ldquo;white&rdquo; line or spot on the edge, your knife is not
sharp. Thereafter, keep it sharp at all times.</p>
<p>You will also need sandpaper to sand down the knife cuts in the wood.</p>
<p>Now for the part that worries most beginners: painting the dolls. If you
have a fairly steady hand, and use a good brush, this should not be too much
of a problem. I have often said that it a person can pare a potato without
wasting it, and can write fairly well, he or she can make a Kachina doll.</p>
<p>We use water colors for painting. That is what the Hopi use, and water
colors are not so messy. While any good brand of water colors will do the
trick, you will have the best success with poster or show-card colors. They
are opaque and cover better than transparent water colors. Although many
of the old Kachina makers use brushes made out of yucca leaf stems, chewed
and trimmed to the sizes required, you can pick up a couple or three small
brushes that will do a better job. Sable-hair brushes are best, but also more
expensive.</p>
<p>Painting the dolls is not as difficult as one may think. Remember&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t have to paint faces, and the masks are all more or less abstract or symbolic
in design. And furthermore you don&rsquo;t have to do any shading or blending.
It is all flat work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>There are two methods of painting. Most of the old-time Kachina makers
give the entire doll a coat of white paint first, and the rest is painted over
that. But usually, with good poster colors to work with, it is easier to lay out
and paint each color directly on the bare wood. The colors dry rather rapidly
and, if used rather thick (not too much water), they will not be apt to run or
bleed where colors overlap. So don&rsquo;t let the painting stop you. I have seen
cub scouts make some very nice looking dolls.</p>
<p>The Indian does nothing to preserve the painted surface and the water
colors are apt to smudge and wear off. On the other hand, a glossy surface
on a doll looks awful, and is not in character. So we suggest that you use a
light spray coat or two of Krylon, or Spray-fix, or any other crystal-clear
spray, such as come in bomb cans. Krylon is a crystal-clear plastic spray, and
Spray-fix is a fixative (in a bomb can) such as is used by artists to prevent
smudging of pencil, charcoal, or pastel drawings. But whatever you use to
preserve the water color, it should be &ldquo;water white&rdquo; and should not be sprayed
on to impart a shiny surface, except where stated otherwise in the following
pages.</p>
<p>Naturally, questions arise as to where one can get ideas for more difficult
kinds of Kachina dolls, or Kachina costumes. Here are a couple of good
books which contain such information: Hopi Kachinas, by Edward Kemrard;
Ceremonial Costumes of the Pueblo Indians, by Virginia Roediger.</p>
<p>Moreover, Kachina dolls are shown from time to time in Arizona Highways
Magazine and there are many crayon drawings of Kachinas, made by a
Hopi Indian, in the 1899-1900 Annual Report of the Bureau of American
Ethnology.</p>

<p>The dolls shown {above}
were carefully drawn from
old specimens in the collection in
the Milwaukee Public Museum.
Each one has a cord around the
neck with a loop at the back for
hanging on a wall.</p>
<p>All the bodies were made from cottonwood roots.
The tablets are of other woods whittled thin. It is
said that the Kachina doll makers, and also the
makers of the actual Kachina masks, pay the most
attention as a rule to the masks. While the rest of
the costumes may vary, the masks usually hold true
to ancient traditional forms and designs.</p>
<p>These dolls will also acquaint the beginner with
the different methods of whittling, particularly the
moccasins and arms. Colors also vary, depending
on what colors are on hand. Today many of the
dolls are painted with poster colors because they
are easier to obtain than formerly.</p>
<p>Most of these old dolls are slightly wider than
they are thick, or shall we say, slightly flattened
from front to back. The Hemis Kachina is shown
here with a green background on the tablet, whereas
recent books show it to be blue: otherwise, the
traditional characteristics are preserved. Indians
often confuse these two colors.</p>

<p>The {Keme} doll shown is an old one brought to
me by a trader. It was in rather poor condition. The paint was
smeared and rubbed off in
places. By carefully matching the original colors,
I went over the entire doll. Note the feet. They are
different from those of any of the five on the
preceding page.</p>
<p>The Crow Kachina is one that I
selected for a lamp base. In the actual costume
there are real crow wings attached to the mask,
but these dolls are also made with wings of wood
in several different styles.</p>
<p>The Hot&rsquo;e Kachina is often used for doll designs,
and here, too, some dolls have small feathers attached
to the mask, while others have wooden symbolic
feathers. Some Hot&eacute; dolls have a miniature
concha belt made of tin and a thin strip of black
leather. The bow and rattle, of course, are slipped
respectively into a notch and a hole in the hands.</p>

<p>For the most part, Indians
tend to make their doll bodies
flat, especially figures ten
inches or more in height. About
the only sawing that is done is
in cutting the space between
the legs. For the beginner we
have shown two types, the
round and the flat. The different
sections are marked as shown by dotted lines,
and from there on in it is just a case of whittling.
Arms, as shown in the lower doll, are whittled out,
but occasionally they are whittled separately and
tacked and glued on. All other appendages, such
as nose, mouth, eyes, ears, and tablets are set into
mortices cut to fit, and glued. While plastic cements
dry quickly, it is better to use a glue that water
color will adhere to. Regular hide glue or Elmer&rsquo;s
glue are fine. You will note that there are a great
many ways of whittling feet. That seems to be a
matter of choice.</p>
<p>Figures should be sandpapered, preferably with
medium-grit sandpaper. The finish can be made to
look very much like the rough texture of cottonwood
root.</p>

<p>Dolls of this type are not
found in many of the western
trading posts, and where
you do find one it will have
quite a price tacked to it.</p>
<p>To make this one, which is
about eight inches high, you&rsquo;ll need for the body
a soft wood block about 2&frac12; by 3 by 8 inches in
dimensions. By enlarging with squares, the sizes of
the various parts can be ascertained. The wings
should be of thin wood, preferably &sup3;/&#8323;&#8322; inch thick.
If a quick-drying glue is used, such as Elmer&rsquo;s Glue-all,
no brads are required. I like to use glue rather
than cement, because water color paints will stick
to places where glue appears, but will not stick to
cement.</p>
<p>These dolls are sometimes glued to a base of
some sort, and so make beautiful lamp bases. However,
when used for that purpose, the doll is not
drilled for wiring. Instead a piece of &#8540;-inch brass
tubing is used, bent as shown in the small sketch
in the lower left-hand corner. Of course, a suitable
shade should be made, one with a Pueblo Indian
design.</p>

<p>The ear ornaments and the necklace are made of
birch dowel rod, which is easy to whittle in miniature.
Plastic screw clamps can be bought at almost
any notion counter, and they are simply cemented
onto the backs of the dolls. Do not make them
more than 1 inch high. The necklaces, also rather
unique, should be strung with wooden beads if
possible to reduce the weight.</p>
<p>For these pieces, several coats of clear nail polish
are used, or clear lacquer. Unlike the larger figures,
they should have a good glossy finish. Owing to
the smallness of some of these figures, it is best to
whittle each on the end of a longer piece of dowel
rod, and then cut it off with a fine coping or jeweler&rsquo;s
saw (See drawing {above}). Then cement
on the clamp in order to have something to hold

<p>I enjoy making lamps, and
have made many Kachina
doll lamps, each different
from the others&mdash;different dolls, different bases,
and different shades. The dolls should be made out
of at least 2-inch wood. A 2&frac12;-inch size is better,
the over-all base and doll measuring about 9 inches
in length. This is a good proportion.</p>
<p>In making bracket lamps, the doll can be set
right on the bracket, as shown at lower left, and
the brackets can be painted to harmonize with the
doll, or stained or painted to match the woodwork
of the house.</p>
<p>I have also made totem pole lamps on this same
principle, using Northwest Coast Indian designs on
base and shade.</p>
<p>In making the drum base shown here, either of
two methods may be used. When I have a lot of
time, I lace rawhide over the block and paint it.
Usually, however, I simply paint the circular base
to resemble an Indian tom-tom.</p>

</div>
<p>Since shades, in order to
harmonize with Kachina doll
lamps, cannot be bought in
stores, they will have to be
made. There are three types
of shade that will look good: the cylindrical shade;
the conventional round, tapered shade; and the
square shade. Round shades should be selected for
round bases, and square shades for square bases.</p>
<p>Use smooth three-ply drawing or bristol board,
and transparent water colors are better than poster
colors.</p>
<p>Shades can be parchmentized by applying a mixture
of one part turpentine and two parts mineral
oil. Apply the mixture to both sides with a wad of
absorbent cotton, and wipe off the surplus. This is
done after the shade is painted and glued together,
since glue will not adhere to any oiled surface.</p>
<p>I prefer to leave the paper white, just giving it
several light coats of clear plastic spray to prevent
soiling.</p>
<p>Designs for shades should be appropriate. Southwest
Pueblo designs fit in well, such as thunder
birds, rain birds, Kachina masks, etc. Your library
will no doubt be able to furnish many ideas along
these lines.</p>
<p>If you object to lacing shades to the wire frame,
you can use passe partout binding tape which is
already gummed and only has to be moistened
before applying.</p>

</div>
<p>This is one item that is becoming quite popular
through the West and there seems to be no limit
in what can be done along these lines. You will
probably get a lot of ideas when traveling, but
here are a couple that are slightly &ldquo;different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The top tray can be made of Mexican modeling
clay or some other clay that does not require firing.
In that case the top and inside are not decorated,
and the outside decoration is put on with poster
color and covered with several coats of plastic or
clear lacquer to give it a kiln-dried ceramic appearance.</p>
<p>A cigarette box can also be made in the shape
of a Kachina mask as a companion piece to the
tray. While the lower tray has the conventional general
shape, it could also be made with vertical sides.</p>
<p>A few years ago it was rather difficult to obtain
a good turquoise blue, but it is now on the market.</p>

<p>This canister speaks for itself. There is this much
to be said for it: the lady of the house isn&rsquo;t so apt
to hide it when she is preparing for guests.</p>
<p>As with any Kachina project, there is practically
no limit to what can be done in regard to design.
You can take your pick of masks, and can select
the appendages that you like best.</p>
<p>Coffee cans have just about the proper shape
and proportions for these canisters, and the covers
fit tightly. Be sure to smooth down the edges of
the can, using fine emery or other abrasive cloth.</p>
<p>The inside of the can should be given a coat of
clear lacquer to prevent rust from forming, since
many brands of tobacco are slightly damp.</p>

</div>
<p>Slides are always in demand in scouting, and we
show here four different methods of making them.</p>
<p>Those made of wood are very colorful. In making
the full figure, only the vertical, front half of the
form is used, and a ring of any material may be
attached to the back.</p>
<p>Metal slides require a little more work. Aluminum
is a good metal for youngsters. This requires no
welding, but the tablet is fastened to the mask
with a tight drive fit.</p>
<p>Silver, of course, is for the finished craftsman,
and anyone familiar with silver soldering methods
can easily produce one like that shown at the bottom
of the page. If turquoise is used, so much the
better.</p>
<p>These metal slides are eye-catchers, since they
are not to be found in stores.</p>

<p class="pcapc">It is necessary to add a metal base such as
this on light-weight bookends. Be sure there

<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CEILING LIGHT FIXTURE</span></h2>
<p>Probably your thought on this fixture will be, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put
that in a living room.&rdquo; Not in any or every living room, but I
know a beautiful large living room where a similar one is hung
and it certainly sets off the Navaho rugs and Indian baskets and
pottery in that room. This fixture would be ideal in a den or
recreation room.</p>
<p>A cluster of four light bulbs should light it, or a socket can be
set on each of the four sides. Frosted, or better still, an opal
glass should be used. The side pieces are taken from the woven
designs on Hopi women&rsquo;s dresses, predominantly black.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">BOOK ENDS</span></h2>
<p>These can also be made without the back or upright; that is,
the doll would be set flush with the back edge of the base. But
the metal base must be added unless the wooden base is well
weighted with lead. I have made them that way, but prefer the
thin metal piece instead. Twenty-gauge brass works out nicely.
To fasten it, use small flat-head screws, countersunk, and give
the metal a coat of thin shellac where it fits into the wood. Wood
and metal must be flush along the bottom.</p>

</div>
<p>These attractive gate posts
are rather easy to make. I used
sections of old electric-line or
telephone poles. They are of
cedar and will withstand the
weather. After cleaning the surface of the post
with a drawknife, it is worked with a small hand ax,
chisel, and mallet. Note the 2-foot or 3-foot projection
left on the bottom to set it.</p>
<p>Paint with ordinary house paint and, if you wish,
finish with a coat of clear varnish to protect the
paint. I used water colors and finished with two
coats of clear spar varnish. But house paints are
easier to obtain.</p>
<p>The hearth posts may be flattened somewhat at
the back to fit tightly against the fireplace. Telephone
poles make the best material as they are well
seasoned. The mantel shelf should be at least 2
inches thick. Three inches would be better, and
could be effected by gluing a 3-inch piece of &#8542;-inch
lumber around the front and two ends to give
it the appearance of a solid 3-inch plank.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
